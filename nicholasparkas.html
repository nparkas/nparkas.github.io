      <h1>Lebron James Breaks Record</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James
      recorded his 10,000th career rebound in Wednesday’s 111-104 loss to the
      Indiana Pacers, becoming the first player ever to reach 30,000 points,
      10,000 rebounds and 9,000 assists.</p>
  <p>He is just the 42nd player in NBA history to reach the milestone, joining his teammates
     Dwight Howard and DeAndre Jordan as the only active players with 10,000-plus career boards.</p>
    <p>With 4:11 remaining in 4th quarter, LeBron reaches for the ball following Pacers forward
      Torrey Craig’s missed 3-pointer to notch his 10,000th rebound of his career.
      He finished the game with 12 boards along with 30 points, five assists and two steals.</p>
